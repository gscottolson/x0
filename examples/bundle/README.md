# x0 bundle example

```sh
npm install
```

## Dev Server

```sh
npm start
```

Editing `pages/index.js` will live update in the development server.

## Static Build

```sh
npm run build
```

This will save a `bundle.js` file which will rehydrate state in the `index.html`.

To view the output app, run a local server in the `dist/` directory.
